Try to push from another local repository
Is it because of the same user on local machine got the project?
The result is:
	- new file created by user on local machine but from another directory cloned from Hub;
	- added to git;
	- commited;
	- pushed without any requests for username or password;
	- Hub and the creator repositories got the file!
